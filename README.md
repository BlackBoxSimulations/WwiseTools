# WwiseTools
A collection of tools that aid in using Wwise inside of Unity:

Wwise tools that Krystian, my brother, and myself built for our audio engineer to improve workflow.
The repository can be added as a sub-module or sub-tree to improve Unity Project workflow. The project contains simple utilities and extensions to prevent having to rewrite code.

- One tool that we found odd that Wwise did not have a serialized version of the event names. To avoid having to hardcode names into our code, we added a Wwise event dropdown menu

- The other tool we were surprised to see missing from Wwise was the ability to mute audio.  If you share an office with a group of people, I donâ€™t have to explain how bothersome it is to hear everyones audio playing or having to miss Slack notifications because your whole computer is muted.
